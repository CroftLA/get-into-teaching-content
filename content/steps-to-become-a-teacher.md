  <!--<p><strong>To become a primary or secondary school teacher in England you will need to have a degree, or equivalent qualification.</strong></p>-->
  <p>To start initial teacher training, you'll need to have a degree, or equivalent qualification.</p>
  <p>If you're unsure whether your qualification is equivalent to a degree, you can <a href="#talk-to-us">talk to us, or chat online</a>.</p> 

 <p>
    Here's what you need to do if you:

  <ul>

  <li><span><a href="/international-candidates">have an overseas degree</a></span></li>
  <li><span><a href="/returning-to-teaching">are returning to teach in England</a></span></li>
  </ul>
  
 <p>If you want to teach in a fee-paying or private school, the rules may be different. You’ll need to check with the school you want to teach at.</p>
 
  <h3>If you have a degree</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to teach in a primary or secondary school you can apply for postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) to give you qualified teacher status (QTS).  This usually takes a year, unless you study part-time.  All ITT courses include a minimum of 24 weeks in school - usually two schools or more.
      </p>
      <p>
        To study for ITT, you’ll need these qualifications or their equivalents:
      </p>
      
   <ul>
      <li><span>English GCSE grade 4 (C) or above</span></li>
      <li><span>Maths GCSE grade 4 (C) or above</span></li>
      <li><span>Science GCSE grade 4 (C) or above if you want to teach in primary education</span></li>
  </ul>
  
   <p>
        If you do not have the required GCSEs, you’ll need to show that you have an equivalent level of education.
