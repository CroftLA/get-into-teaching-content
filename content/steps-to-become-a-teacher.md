 <p>If you want to teach in a fee-paying or private school, the rules may be different. You’ll need to check with the school you want to teach at.</p>
 
  <h1>If you have a degree</h1>
      <p>
        If you want to teach in a primary or secondary school you can apply for postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) to give you qualified teacher status (QTS).  This usually takes a year, unless you study part-time.  All ITT courses include a minimum of 24 weeks in school - usually two schools or more.
      </p>
      <p>
        To study for ITT, you’ll need these qualifications or their equivalents:
      </p>
      
   <ul>
      <li><span>English GCSE grade 4 (C) or above</span></li>
      <li><span>Maths GCSE grade 4 (C) or above</span></li>
      <li><span>Science GCSE grade 4 (C) or above if you want to teach in primary education</span></li>
  </ul>
  
   <p>
        If you do not have the required GCSEs, you’ll need to show that you have an equivalent level of education.

    <h1>Get school experience</h1>
  <p>Before you commit to a teacher training course, you might like to get some valuable experience in a school and find out what it’s really like to become a teacher.</p>  
  <p>This isn’t compulsory, but most teacher training providers will want you to have it and it will look good on your application.</p>

  <h1>Find your way to train</h1>

  <p>To work as a teacher in state schools in England, you’ll need ‘Qualified Teacher Status’ (QTS).</p>

  <p>You’ll need to make some key decisions about teaching before you decide how to train:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><span><span>which age group and subject you want to teach</span></span></li>
  <li><span><span>whether you will train in a school or university</span></span></li>
  <li><span><span>which teaching qualification you want to achieve</span></span></li>
  <li><span><span>how long you want to train for</span></span></li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Teaching children with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND)</h1>
      <p>
        All teaching courses with QTS include training on working with pupils with SEND.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could also specialise in supporting children with SEND.
