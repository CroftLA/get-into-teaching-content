   <h2>Advice for current trainees</h2>
        <p>If you are a current trainee teacher and would like information on how COVID-19 might affect your course, please contact your provider. This also applies if you are on an assessment only route.</p>
        
   <h2>Impact of COVID-19 on applicants</h2>
        <p>If you are applying for a course starting from September 2020, find out what you need to know about the impact of COVID-19 on preparing and submitting your application.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What if I cannot attend school experience prior to interview?</strong></p>
        <p>A.  Prior experience in a school is not required prior to interview, but if you have been able to gain experience in schools, providers might find reports from those schools helpful.</p>  
        <p>Applicants should wait to be contacted by the providers for specific guidance.</p>
        <p><strong>Q. Does the 40-day rule for making decisions about ITT applications still apply?</strong></p>
        <p>A. The 40-day rule for making decisions about ITT applications was reinstated on 1 June. From 1 July this will be reduced to 20 days.</p>
        <p><strong>Q. Do I have to have a face-to-face interview?</strong></p>
        <p>A. There is no requirement for a face-to-face interview. These can take place electronically, ideally by Skype or similar. Documentation such as degree and GCSE certificates may be scanned and sent electronically.</p>
        <p>Applicants should wait to be contacted by the providers for specific guidance.</p>
        <p><strong>Q. Can I start my postgraduate ITT course before I have been awarded my degree?</strong></p>
        <p>A. Providers are currently making arrangements to enable academic assessments to take place, to minimise the delay of degree awards. Given that programme design may differ between institutions, applicants are encouraged to contact their respective degree awarding body for details.</p>
       <p><strong> Q: I’m expecting to get a bursary/scholarship/student finance for my course starting in September. Will this still be available?</strong></p>
        <p>A. Yes. The information in the <a href="../funding-your-training/index">Funding your training</a> section of the website remains valid.</p>
        <p><strong>Q. What if I have been unable to complete my Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course?</strong></p>
        <p>A. SKE training courses can be completed before or alongside ITT. If you have been unable to complete a SKE course, the SKE provider will make an assessment and communicate this to your ITT provider. If necessary, you can defer your SKE course and complete this alongside your ITT course at a later date.</p>
       <p><strong> Q. Are the planned Train to Teach events going ahead?</strong></p>
        <p>A. As a consequence of the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) and following the announcement to introduce social distancing and limit all non-essential contact, we have made the decision to cancel all upcoming face to face Train to Teach events. We apologise for any inconvenience.</p>
        <p>All upcoming Train to Teach events have been set-up as online question and answer sessions. For more information and to register for these events visit our events page.</p>
       <p><strong> Q. What if I’m an overseas applicant?</strong></p>
        <p>A. Although global travel, including to the UK, is affected by coronavirus, we still encourage you to take the steps to becoming a teacher in England.</p> 
        <p>Check your country’s advice to keep up to date with travel restrictions. The UK government has also published guidance about what to do if you need a visa to travel to the UK and has an immigration helpline. If you’ve already started applying for a course, contact the training providers - they’ll be able to advise you on how coronavirus is affecting recruitment to their courses.</p>
        
   <h3>GCSE and equivalency tests</h3>
        <p><strong>Q. Because of coronavirus, I have been unable to sit my GCSE or equivalency test as scheduled. Will this mean I cannot meet the entry criteria to start a course in September 2020?</strong></p>
       <p> A. Providers are permitted to take account of other evidence of attainment. In the first instance, if you think you can provide evidence that you can demonstrate a standard equivalent to GCSE grade 4 in one or more of the required subjects (English, mathematics, and additionally a science subject for primary), you should check your eligibility with your chosen provider. Providers may offer opportunities for you to demonstrate the standard through, for example, equivalency tests.</p>
        <p>If you cannot provide the required evidence as a consequence of the coronavirus outbreak, providers have temporary flexibility to allow you to start a course. You will need to submit this evidence by 30 November 2020 in order to continue on and complete the course. Candidates should check with their respective providers.</p>
        <p><strong>Q. Will I still be eligible for bursaries and grants if, due to coronavirus, I start a course without having provided this evidence?</strong></p>
        <p>A. If you begin a course with evidence of your GCSE standard equivalent pending, initially you will not be eligible for financial incentives. However, once you have submitted evidence, any financial incentive will be backdated to the start of the course. Your eligibility for a student loan will be unaffected.</p>
