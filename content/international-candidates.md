  <h2 id="qts">Qualified teacher status (QTS)</h2>
  
  <p>In many schools funded by the UK government in England ('<a href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state schools <span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new

  <p>International qualified teachers are allowed to work as a teacher in England for up to 4 years without QTS.  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recruit-teachers-from-overseas#employing-overseas-teachers-without-qts-the-4-year-rule"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about the ‘4 year rule’<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new

<h2 id="work-visas">How to apply for a visa which allows you to work or study in the UK</h2>

<p>If you are a non-UK citizen from a country outside the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea#:~:text=The%20EEA%20includes%20EU%20countries,UK%20as%20other%20EEA%20nationals." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Economic Area<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new

window)</span><i class="icon icon-external"></i></a>.</p>

<h2>EU Settlement Scheme</h2>

<p>If you are a citizen of a country inside the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Economic Area<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new
window)</span><i class="icon icon-external"></i></a> (EEA) or Switzerland, living in the UK by 31 December 2020, you can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.</p> 

<p>If your application is successful, you can continue to live, work and study in the UK after 30 June 2021. You will not need to use the points-based immigration system explained here.</p>

<h2>Changes to the UK’s immigration system</h2> 

<p>From 1 January 2021, the UK is introducing a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new points-based immigration system<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new
window)</span><i class="icon icon-external"></i></a>.</p> 

<p>The new system will apply to all non-UK citizens arriving in the UK from that date, including those from the EEA or Switzerland.</p> 

<p>You can now apply for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">student visa<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new
window)</span><i class="icon icon-external"></i></a> under the new system; other immigration routes to live and work in the UK will open over the course of 2020.</p>

<h2>Irish citizens</h2>

<p>Irish citizens will continue to be able to enter, work and study in the UK as they do now.</p>

<h2>Choosing the correct visa for your teaching job or teacher training course</h2>

<p>For teaching jobs in England, the main visa route  is the ‘<a href="#https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know#skilled-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skilled worker visa<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new
window)</span><i class="icon icon-external"></i></a>’.</p>

<p>For teacher training in England, the main routes are either the ‘<a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">student visa<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new
window)</span><i class="icon icon-external"></i></a>’ or the ‘<a href="#https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know#skilled-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skilled worker visa<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new

<p>Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be eligible for <a href="#other-visas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other visas<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new
window)</span><i class="icon icon-external"></i></a> which allow you to work or study in the UK.</p> 

<h3>Teacher training: skilled worker or student visa?</h3>

<p>The type of visa you need will depend on whether you are on a salaried or unsalaried teacher training course. (See also our <a href="#other-visas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guidance on other visas<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new
window)</span><i class="icon icon-external"></i></a> you may be eligible for.)</p>

<p>A ‘salaried’ teacher training course means you are paid to work in a school while you learn to teach.</p> 

<p>An ‘unsalaried’ teacher training course means you pay a fee to study as a teacher.</p>

 <h2 id="other-visas">Ways to train or work as a teacher in the UK without a skilled worker visa or a student visa</h2>


<h3>Graduate visa</h3>
