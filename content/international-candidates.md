<p>If you’re from overseas you’ll need to know if you have the right qualifications to teach or train to teach in England.</p>


<p>You can become a teacher in England if you meet one of the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a degree or equivalent qualification that allows you to start to train as a teacher</li>
  <li>you are a qualified teacher in a country outside of England</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t meet either of those requirements, you will need to study for a degree, or equivalent, that enables you to teach in England.</p>



<p>These are some of the things you might need to think about before you decide to teach in England:</p>


<ul>
  <li>funding</li>
  <li>visas</li> 
  <li>travelling to the UK</li>
</ul>
