<h2>Choosing the correct visa for your teacher training course</h2>

<p>Some teacher training courses in England are ‘salaried’. This means you are paid to work in a school while you learn to teach.</p> 

<p>Other teacher training courses are ‘unsalaried’. This means you pay a fee to study as a teacher.</p>  

<p>The type of visa you need will depend on whether you are on a salaried or unsalaried teacher training course.</p>

<h3>Salaried and unsalaried courses</h3>

<p>Salaried includes the School Direct salaried programme, the Teach First Leadership Development programme and postgraduate teaching apprenticeships.</p>
<p>Unsalaried includes higher education institution programmes, school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) programmes and the School Direct fee-funded programme.</p>
