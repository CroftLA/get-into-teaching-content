<h3>Read about Katie's return to teaching in England after working at an international school in China</h2>

<p><strong>Why did you decide to come back to teach in England?</strong></p> 
<p>I wanted to move back to England to be closer to my partner.  The main thing I missed about teaching in England was the curriculum and approach to teaching and learning.  We’re so fortunate to have so many research-based educators here who share their ideas at exciting events like ResearchEd. I missed being at the cutting edge of educational research, like I felt I had been when working in London.</p>
<p><strong>How did you find a job?</strong></p>
<p>I began looking for jobs in January, because the resignation date in my international school was Christmas, and you had to resign before looking for jobs. I looked in the normal places like ETeach and TES. </p> 
<p>Before applying, I always emailed the head teacher of the school to ask if they would consider international applicants and if they would interview me via Skype. I offered them reassurance that I was suitably qualified by providing additional references, copies of previous performance management reviews and videos of me teaching.</p>  
<p>The head teachers were always very grateful for me being so proactive and considerate of the fact that interviewing by Skype was a new concept to them.   I applied for about ten jobs and was offered four Skype interviews. I was offered a job in February, two months after I started looking.  I was used to Skype interviews from applying to international schools, so I probably found it less daunting than the head teachers did!</p> 
<p>My international school was very supportive. They contacted the head teachers in England to describe my teaching and to offer them reassurance.  They also provided permission for me to share my performance management reviews and videos of me teaching.</p>
<p><strong>How did you plan relocating to start your new job?</strong></p>
<p>Moving from China to England was very easy. Like most international schools, my school had a very comprehensive repatriation package and arranged my flights and shipment.  They even arranged for my cat to be repatriated for me!  Once in England, I initially stayed with my parents before starting to house-hunt.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like being back in a UK school?</strong></p>
<p>Starting back at an English state school was much like starting any new job. It’s always hard starting a new job – so much to learn!  But it didn’t feel any different just because it was back in England. By October half term, my new school felt like home.</p>
<p><strong>What did you do to get back up to date with teaching in England?</strong></p>
<p>Even though I was only away for two years, in that time a new GCSE curriculum and a new Ofsted Framework were introduced! While in China, I stayed in touch with the UK education scene via Twitter to find links to blog and book recommendations. Also, whenever I was home in England for the holidays, I visited UK schools and went on UK-based courses.</p> 
<p>As for behaviour management – teenagers are teenagers! I still had to manage behaviour in China in the same way I did back in London, so I didn’t lose any of my skills there!</p>
<p><strong>What have you most enjoyed about being back in a school in England?</strong></p>
<p>The freedom to teach the way I want to. I felt a huge amount of pressure in a fee-paying international school (where parents call a certain amount of the shots!) to teach in a certain way. Back home.  I find it so much easier to engage with research, learn new things about teaching and then try them out in the classroom – without being judged! I feel so professionally free in England.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to someone planning on returning to teach in England?</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>when applying for jobs back in the UK, contact the head teachers in advance of applying</li>
  <li>engage with Twitter, blogs, and education books to stay up-to-date while away</li>
  <li>visit schools and attend conferences on your visits back to the UK</li>
  <li>Do not worry about behaviour management – honestly, teenagers are teenagers everywhere!</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Read about Shaun returning to the classroom with international experience </h3>
  
 <p>“I taught abroad for a number of years and returned to the UK in 2017. On returning, I felt teaching back in the UK was too daunting as things had moved on a lot since I was last in a UK classroom.</p>
 
 <p>I tried my hand at various other jobs, but felt that it just didn't give me the same job satisfaction as teaching. After signing up to talk to a teacher training adviser, they got in touch and were very supportive, giving me lots of advice and resources.</p> 

<p>The support helped me through my applications, giving me feedback that was valuable in ensuring I had the best chance of getting to interview.</p>
<p>For example, they highlighted things that I may have missed from the job specification and provided background information about the school. I believe the advice for approaching the observed lesson was exceptional – I received lots of great ideas (especially for science practicals).</p>

<p>I think it’s very easy to try and do too much in an observed lesson and my adviser was great at identifying this and suggesting other approaches. I was also signposted to continuous professional development (CPD) opportunities that would help get me back into the classroom.</p>

<p>I was initially concerned my teaching experience abroad may have been an issue in terms of successfully getting a post. To overcome this, I drew comparisons between the curriculum I was teaching internationally and the curriculum in the UK, and how any differences could benefit the wider curriculum of the school.</p>

<p>I was also concerned that gaps in employment and time away from teaching would possibly be another barrier to getting back into teaching. To help combat this, I explained these gaps to my adviser and highlighted what CPD I had done.</p>

<p>I found during interviews that gaps were never raised and schools were more interested in how I performed on the day, i.e. in the observed lesson with students, with the interview panel and in general interactions with staff.</p>

<p>I owe a great deal of thanks to my adviser for supporting me through the return to teaching process and am very happy to learn that they will continue to support me for the first two months of my post.</p>
