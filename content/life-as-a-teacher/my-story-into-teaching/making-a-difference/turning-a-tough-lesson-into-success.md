               I started in quite a hard school in a deprived area. I taught there for three years and it was tough, but extremely rewarding.

                    <h1>Teaching is a massive responsibility; you’re tasked with working with hundreds of students each day, and they’re placed into your care – that’s quite a demanding responsibility. But it’s part of what you do as a teacher.<span class="icon-quote quote-close"></span></h1>

<p>Behaviour management skills need to be absolutely spot-on if the students are to learn in your lessons, because there are a lot of barriers that can prevent the students from accessing that learning.</p>

  <p>I’ve worked with students who are, almost, PE refusers. Most you manage to get on-side and work with, but some have a preconceived view that it’s not for them.</p>
<p>They arrived to the lesson – a rugby lesson – and they detested the idea. It took a lot of work, a great deal of effort to turn their minds around and see what the sport could offer them.</p>
<p>These year 10s had arrived with the view that they weren’t going to do rugby and that it wasn’t for them.</p>
<p>Once we got out to the field, they weren’t prepared to take part at all. I had to start my lesson with a talk about how I would deliver the lesson in a way that’s accessible to them, that they could enjoy. I basically asked them to give me a chance, to go with it and see how they get on.</p>
<p>There’s so many different things you can do with rugby – you take out that physical side of the game and it’s still competitive, it still requires the same skills.</p>
<p>That lesson had been quite a challenge for me to turn around, and – seeing them turn up to play rugby in their own time – I really felt like I’d achieved something.</p>
