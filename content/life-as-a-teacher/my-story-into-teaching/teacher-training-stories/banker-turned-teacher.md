                    <h2>Katherine Hills, <br>Modern foreign languages</h2>

            <p class="prominent">
                I always wanted to teach, I wanted to instil a love of languages in young people, but I also knew I didn’t have to pursue that ambition straight after graduating. I worked for 4 years in an investment bank before training to teach.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have always loved languages and have seen first-hand how they open doors – both from a personal, and professional point of view. Learning and teaching languages is also really good fun and I get a real buzz when my students are able to express themselves.
            </p>
            <div>
                <div class="quote-block">
                    <span class="icon-quote"></span>
                    <h1>I get a real buzz from teaching.'<span class="icon-quote quote-close"></span></h1>
                </div>
               <p>
                  It’s amazing when I walk around school and hear my top-set year 7s chatting to each other in Spanish and debating the correct adjective agreement!
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
            I did extensive research to make sure that I was training somewhere where I would be a ‘good fit’ and that had a great reputation for training.
            </p>
            <p>
            I also thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to participate in a wide range of school activities and would recommend others do the same.
            </p>
            <p>
            Get involved in everything that you can, shadow a key stage you don’t teach, observe teachers outside of your department, be in the staff Christmas panto, or help out on a school trip.
            </p>
            <p>
            It sometimes feels like you have no spare time, but when you are in training is when you have the most opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
            And get as much feedback as you can, from as many people as you can, and learn from it.
