          I always wanted to work in an environment that was never going to be the same every day – teaching definitely provides this. 
          Working with students from different backgrounds and preparing them to take their next steps towards success was 
          always a huge draw to the profession.
          </p>
          <p>As a teacher, you’ll have the opportunity to develop and succeed in your career to realise your professional and personal ambitions.
          Before I was assistant headteacher I enjoyed a number of different roles learning new skills 
       that have helped me to move forward in my career.

               <span class="icon-quote"></span>
                   <strong class="quote-block__content">There are plenty of progression opportunities in teaching – you just have to grasp them.
                   <span class="icon-quote quote-close"></span></strong>
             </div>
        <h3>Take on a challenge</h3>
              <p>When I started teaching as a newly qualified teacher, I looked for opportunities to support the school 
              and to enhance my experience.</p> 
              <p>For example, in my first year, I led on re-designing the KS3 curriculum, and in my second year I started to 
         become involved in the school’s virtual learning environment. 
         All of this added to my experience and provided me with plenty to talk about when applying for new roles.
	        </p>
          </div>
          <p>My long-term plan is to go into headship, but do not want to rush this. I want to be able to experience a range of different areas in
         schools to ensure that I am fully prepared for the challenges that a headship role will bring.
         </p>
         <p>I feel fortunate to be on the leadership salary, but I don’t do the job for the money – for me it’s about supporting students as a
         teacher and leader and making sure they achieve their full potential.
