                I couldn’t have made a better decision. I love the challenge of raising my standards as well as the school’s, and being a role model for other teachers in my department.
            </p>
<p>
	I developed a reputation for delivering exceptional lessons and became an outstanding reflective practitioner. I also had a positive impact on each student, helping them develop and meet all areas of the curriculum and beyond.
	</p> 
<h3>Getting noticed</h3>
        <p>What got me noticed as a teacher were the improvements I made to the directional and strategic change of my school. I was recognised not only as a great teacher, but as a future leader.

	<p>
    <br/>
	As I have progressed, I do less teaching and more leadership and management. I believe it is necessary to still be involved in the classroom as I am still responsible for student attainment. 
	</p>
	<p>
Above all, you can’t develop a vision that staff can buy into and deliver if you are not fully involved in the school.
