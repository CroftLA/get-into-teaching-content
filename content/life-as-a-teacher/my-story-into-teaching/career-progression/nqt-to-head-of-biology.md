                    <h2>Sarah Fisher, <br/>Head of biology</h2>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="prominent">
                Two years after qualifying as a teacher, I progressed to head of biology, climbing the career ladder. I always had an inkling that teaching was the right direction.
            </p>
            <h3>I knew teaching was for me</h3>
                <p>From an early age, I knew a teaching career was for me. I could not imagine working a typical nine-to-five desk job. Every day in teaching brings a new challenge and new situations, which is what makes the job so exciting.
                </p>
            <p>When your pupils have those ‘light bulb’ moments, hearing the sudden ‘So that’s how it works!’ and seeing them take your subject into A level and beyond makes the job so worthwhile.
            </p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <span class="icon-quote"></span>
                    <h1>The best part of teaching is being in front of my 32 students and seeing how my passion for the subject I teach rubs off on them<span class="icon-quote quote-close"></span></h1>
                </div>
                <h3>So grateful</h3>
               <p>
                  I am extremely proud of my teaching achievements and career progression so far. The encouragement and support from my head of faculty really helped; they saw the potential in me and I’m so grateful for that 				opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With my leadership skills, my department has gone from strength to strength. We have managed to increase uptake of students from a class of 20 A level students to 50. This was a great achievement, and I could not have done this without the support of my colleagues and the leadership courses I attended.
		        </p>
                <p>I also act as a teaching and learning mentor, which allows me to work with staff from all departments to enhance and develop their teaching and learning. 
                </p>
                <p>I love being able to work with teachers of all backgrounds, experienced to newly qualified, sharing good practice and developing whole-school strategies. I am currently facilitating an NQT leadership programme for teachers across the borough, which I am thoroughly enjoying.
		        </p>
                <h3>My advice</h3>
                <p>I would recommend hard work, maintaining your love for the job, and a want to bring about positive change to young peoples' lives. Undeniably, teaching is hard work – but the knowledge that you have helped to motivate young people and helped shape their future brings more satisfaction than any other job I can think of.
