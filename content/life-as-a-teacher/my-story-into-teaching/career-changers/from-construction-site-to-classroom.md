            <p class="prominent">
                I am an engineering graduate and began my career as a quantity surveyor in the construction industry. I actually worked on a number of school construction projects. After 5 years, I  decided the time was right for a change.

            From organisation and communication skills to dealing with clients inside the company, that all gets transferred into dealing with colleagues, parents, and students. Management skills are most definitely useful in a classroom environment too.

                    <h1>Teaching has always been something I have wanted to do. My uncle came out of early retirement and became a history teacher – this reassured me that I could make the transition to the profession at any age.<span class="icon-quote quote-close"></span></h1>
                </div>
               <p>
                  The financial support definitely helped because it meant that I didn’t have to make any significant cutbacks. The bursary covered most of my costs.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Working in construction, scale drawings are used all the time. I have encouraged my students to consider how maths can be used in practical terms, so they’re not just applying theories from a textbook, they’re learning how maths is applicable to everyday situations.
