            <p class="prominent">
                I graduated with a BSc in sport and human movement studies, and then went on to achieve Master’s degrees in sports biomechanics and exercise nutrition science. I had a career in the police force and feel this has shaped who I am as a teacher.

                    <span class="icon-quote"></span>
                    <h1>As a qualified coach, I particularly enjoy the overwhelming satisfaction I get when a child I’ve been teaching has mastered a skill.<span class="icon-quote quote-close"></span></h1>
                </div>
                <p>
                    During my time as a police officer, I built my communication skills effectively and have been able to bring them into the classroom.  It gave me the understanding that some children do not have the ideal home life.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
               I’m really keen to promote the importance of PE both in school and in everyday life, and away from sport, I want children to see the importance of subjects like maths and not to be afraid of it.
