            <p class="prominent">
                With a Masters in applied translation studies, I set out on a career with a language services company. I’ve always enjoyed sharing my knowledge of languages, so teaching was a natural step. Using my language skills was a key to my role, but it didn’t provide opportunities for interaction.  
            </p>
            <p>
            I opted for a school-led route into teaching to get qualified, which allowed me to be based in a school from the very start of training. It gave me more time to put the theory I learnt at a university into practice.
            </p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <span class="icon-quote"></span>
                    <h1>I decided it wasn’t something I could see myself doing in the long term, as there was no sense of purpose. Teaching, for this reason, has so far provided this in spades!<span class="icon-quote quote-close"></span></h1>
                </div>
               <p>
                  This style of training is very much a hands-on approach to learning to teach, with the focus on the practicalities in the classroom.  It also helps pupils to accept you as a member of staff from the beginning instead of an outsider part-way through term. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
            I was also supported by a university, which I attended once a week, where we learnt the pedagogy to support classroom experiences.  Interacting with lots of different people – both children and adults – and the varied work from beginners to advanced level.
            </p>
            <p>
            I got valuable school experience which meant I could observe lessons in a school and talk to teachers. I really recommend doing this as it will help you know if you would actually be able to cope with a group of children!
