                Karen is a French and Spanish teacher at Norbury Manor Business Enterprise College for Girls. Despite having enjoyed a successful career as the director of two large market research agencies, she'd always harboured a long-term ambition to teach. This desire to make a difference ultimately inspired her to train on a School Direct course.

                "I'd always had teaching in mind," says Karen, "because I'd really enjoyed the work I'd done with young people and children in my previous job. I felt a spark and the creativity that comes with that. I wanted to become a teacher for that reason but also because of the passion and enthusiasm I have for languages, which I wanted to pass on."

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <span class="icon-quote"></span>
                    <h1>The best parts of teaching for me are seeing that lightbulb moment when a child suddenly understands something they didn't before.<span class="icon-quote quote-close"></span></h1>

                <p>
                    Making the decision to leave an established career wasn't easy, so Karen wanted to do some research to ensure she was making the right decision. She initially attended a Train to Teach Roadshow, taking the opportunity to speak to experienced teachers, schools and universities that offer teacher training and fellow professionals seeking to establish a new career in teaching.

                "I'd assumed that my age would be a barrier, but it absolutely wasn't," she recalls, "everybody was very welcoming and said, â€˜You're absolutely not too old to become a teacher, we're looking for people like you'." 
            </p>
            <p>
                Karen then set about researching her options on the Get Into Teaching website, finding out about how to arrange school experience so she could get a feel for teaching. Getting this taste for what the profession has to offer galvanised her determination to teach, so she set about investigating her options. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                When reflecting on her decision to change careers, Karen has nothing but words of encouragement for those thinking of doing the same: "It's really rewarding. You will find it very varied, very challenging and you'll find it intellectually stimulating because it will make you think about your subject in a different way. Definitely do it. I don't regret it for a moment."
