  You’ll find it useful to get some classroom experience, although it’s not
  compulsory. You’ll see teaching in action and it can help you make a decision
  whether or not teaching is right for you.

Spending time in a school will also help you understand some of the skills and qualities teachers have.

Teachers need the ability to:

* relate to pupils and their parents
* be creative to inspire and motivate pupils
* deal with conflict and remain calm in stressful situations
* constantly learn and improve

Your experience can help you decide whether teaching is right for you.

Use the [Get school experience](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/) service.

Do a [teaching internship](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/paid-internships-for-teaching) if you’re a STEM-related degree student. STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics and refers to any subjects that come under these four areas.
