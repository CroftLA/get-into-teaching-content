      You’ll find it useful to get some classroom experience, although it’s not compulsory. You’ll see teaching in action and it can help you make a decision whether or not teaching is right for you. <!--get a taste of school life-->.</p>
      
   <p>Spending time in a school will also help you understand some of the skills and qualities teachers have.</p>
      
  <p>Teachers need the ability to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>relate to pupils and their parents</li>
      <li>be creative to inspire and motivate pupils</li>
      <li>deal with conflict and remain calm in stressful situations</li>
      <li>constantly learn and improve</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your experience can help you decide whether teaching is right for you.
