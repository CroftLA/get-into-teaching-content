 <h2>Your training options</h2>
 
 <p>
      For primary and secondary school teaching you’ll need to do postgraduate Initial Teacher Training (ITT) to give you Qualified Teacher Status. You could do your training:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span>at university</span></li>
      <li><span>in a school</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Both types of training will give you lots of classroom experience and the knowledge to teach successfully. The type of course you choose will depend on whether you want to study at a university or be based in a school.
    </p>
    <h1 id="train-at-university">Train at university</h1>
    <p>
      You’ll do a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) or a postgraduate diploma in education (PGDE) to give you QTS. Most courses are full time for one year. You may be able to study part time if the university you choose has this option.
    </p>
    <p>
      During your course you will:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span>study on campus at your chosen university</span></li>
      <li><span>spend 24 weeks on school placements at 2 schools</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Training at university may be the right choice for you if it’s important to you that you will:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span>spend time with other trainee teachers</span></li>
      <li><span>be able to move from a school placement if it doesn’t suit you</span></li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h1 id="train-in-a-school">Train in a school</h1>
    <p>
      This will usually take 1 year. You’ll spend your time learning from experienced teachers by working in the school team whilst studying the theory of teaching at college or university.  These courses lead to QTS and most include a PGCE qualification too, but it’s worth checking with your training provider first to make sure. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Training to teach in a school is often called school-led training.
    </p>
    <p>
      School-led training may be the right choice for you if you want to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span>learn how to become a teacher while you work at a school</span></li>
      <li><span>get a job in the network of schools where you’ve trained</span></li>
    </ul>
