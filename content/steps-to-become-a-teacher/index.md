      <h4>To become a primary or secondary school teacher in England you will need to have a degree.</h4>
      <p>For equivalent qualifications, you’ll need to confirm your qualification is equivalent to a degree.</p>
      <p>If you're unsure, you can chat online with us or call us on Freephone 0800 389 2500.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    You will then need to take a teaching qualification called initial teacher training (ITT). ITT gives you qualified teacher status (QTS). You will need QTS to work as a teacher in state schools in England.

    If you want to teach in a fee-paying or private school, the rules may be different. You’ll need to check with the type of school you want to teach at.

  <h4>If you have a degree</h4>

  <p>
    If you want to teach in a primary or secondary school you can apply for postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) to give you qualified teacher status (QTS).  This usually takes a year, unless you study part-time.  All ITT courses include a minimum of 24 weeks in school - usually two schools or more.
  </p>

  <p>
    To study for ITT, you’ll need:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths GCSE</li>
    <li>science GCSE grade 4 (C) or above, if you want to teach at primary school</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you do not have the required GCSEs, you’ll need to show that you have an equivalent level of education.

  <p>
    There are a number of different ways you can get funding to train as a teacher in England.  
  </p>

  <p>
    These may vary, depending on: 
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>which subject you’re going to teach</li>
    <li>if you’re going to teach in secondary or primary school</li>
    <li>whether you can get a scholarship</li>

  <p>
    For primary and secondary school teaching you’ll do postgraduate Initial Teacher Training (ITT) to give you QTS. You could do your training:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>at university</li>
    <li>in a school</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Both types of training will give you lots of classroom experience and the knowledge to teach successfully. The type of course you choose will depend on whether you want to study at a university or be based in a school.
  </p>

  <h4 id="train-at-university">Train at university</h4>

  <p>
    You’ll do a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) or a postgraduate diploma in education (PGDE) to give you QTS. Most courses are full time for one year. You may be able to study part time if the university you choose has this option.
  </p>

  <p>
    During your course you will:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>study on campus at your chosen university</li>
    <li>spend 24 weeks on school placements at 2 schools</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Training at university may be the right choice for you if it’s important to you that you will:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>spend time with other trainee teachers</li>
    <li>be able to move from a school placement if it doesn’t suit you</li>
  </ul>

  </p>
  
  <h4 id="train-in-a-school">Train in a school</h4>

  <p>
    This will usually take 1 year. You’ll spend your time learning from experienced teachers by working in the school team whilst studying the theory of teaching at college or university.  These courses lead to QTS and most include a PGCE qualification too, but it’s worth checking with your training provider first to make sure. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Training to teach in a school is often called school-led training.
  </p>

  <p>
    School-led training may be the right choice for you if you want to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>learn how to become a teacher while you work at a school</li>
    <li>get a job in the network of schools where you’ve trained</li>
  </ul>

    There are some other <a href="./if-you-need-to-get-the-right-qualifications#specialist-ways-to-get-into-teaching">specialist training options</a> to get into teaching. These include:
    <ul>
      <li>School Direct salaried places</li>
      <li>Postgraduate teaching apprenticeship</li>
      <li>Teach First</li>
      <li>Researchers in schools</li>

    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h4 id="get-school-experience">Get school experience</h4>
  
  <p>
    You’ll find it useful to get some classroom experience, although it’s not compulsory. You’ll see teaching in action and get a taste of school life. Spending time in a school will also help you understand some of the skills and qualities teachers have. Teachers need the ability to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>relate to pupils and their parents</li>
    <li>be creative to inspire and motivate pupils</li>
    <li>deal with conflict and remain calm in stressful situations</li>
    <li>constantly learn and improve</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Your experience can help you decide whether teaching is right for you.

  <p>
    Do a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/paid-internships-for-teaching">teaching internship</a> if you’re a STEM-related degree student.
  </p>

  <p>
    * STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics and refers to any subjects that come under these four areas.

  <h4><a id="teaching-children-with-special-educational-needs">Training to teach children with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND)</a></h4>

  <p>
    All teaching courses with QTS include training on working with pupils who have special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND).
  </p>

  <p>
    You could also specialise in supporting children with SEND.
