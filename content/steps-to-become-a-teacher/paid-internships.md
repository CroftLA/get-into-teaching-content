  <p class="content-alert">If you are an undergraduate on a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics) related degree and are interested in teaching secondary maths or physics, then the Teaching Internship programme could be for you.</p>
  
  
  <p>The programme takes place in schools across England. You will get the opportunity to experience a range of activities to help you get a feel for school life including:</p> 
<ul>
<li>classroom experience - which could include assisting with lessons and providing subject support to pupils</li>
<li>shadowing experienced teachers and observing lessons, followed by a chance to jointly plan and deliver lessons</li>
<li>one-to-one guidance from outstanding classroom teachers</li>
<li>opportunities to network with qualified subject specialists</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to join</h2> 
<p>You will need to apply directly to participating schools and be an undergraduate in any year of study of a STEM related degree. To find out if you're eligible, check with participating schools before submitting your application.</p>

<p>For the best chance of succeeding with your application, sign up to speak with a Teaching Adviser, who will provide one-to-one support in applying to the Teaching Internship Programme and throughout your journey into teaching.</p>
