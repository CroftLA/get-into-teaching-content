  <p class="content-alert">To become a primary or secondary school teacher in England you will need to have a degree.</p>

  <p>For equivalent qualifications, you’ll need to confirm your qualification is equivalent to a degree.</p>

  <p>If you're unsure, you can chat online with us or call us on Freephone 0800 389 2500.</p> 

  <p>
    You will then need to take a teaching qualification called initial teacher training (ITT). ITT gives you qualified teacher status (QTS). You will need QTS to work as a teacher in state schools in England.

    <h4>If you have a degree</h4>
    <p>
      If you want to teach in a primary or secondary school you can apply for postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) to give you qualified teacher status (QTS).  This usually takes a year, unless you study part-time.  All ITT courses include a minimum of 24 weeks in school - usually two schools or more.
    </p>
    <p>
      To study for ITT, you’ll need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span>grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths GCSE</span></li>
      <li><span>science GCSE grade 4 (C) or above, if you want to teach at primary school</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you do not have the required GCSEs, you’ll need to show that you have an equivalent level of education.

  <h4>Get school experience</h4>
<p>Before you commit to a teacher training course, you might like to get some valuable experience in a school and find out what it’s really like to become a teacher.</p>  
<p>This isn’t compulsory, but most teacher training providers will want you to have it and it will look good on your application.</p>

<h4>Find your way to train</h4>

<p>To work as a teacher in state schools in England, you’ll need ‘Qualified Teacher Status’ (QTS).</p>

<p>You’ll need to make some key decisions about teaching before you decide how to train:</p>

<ul>
<li><span>which age group and subject you want to teach</span></li>
<li><span>whether you will train in a school or university</span></li>
<li><span>which teaching qualification you want to achieve</span></li>
<li><span>how long you want to train for</span></li>
</ul>

<h4>Teaching children with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND)</h4>
    <p>
      All teaching courses with QTS include training on working with pupils with SEND.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could also specialise in supporting children with SEND.
