  <p>If you’re from overseas you’ll need to know if you have the right qualifications to teach or train to teach in England.</p>
  <p>You can become a teacher in England if you meet one of the following requirements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>you have a degree or equivalent qualification that allows you to start to train as a teacher</span></li>
    <li><span>you are a qualified teacher in a country outside of England</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you don’t meet either of those requirements, you will need to study for a degree, or equivalent, that enables you to teach in England.</p>
  <p>These are some of the things you might need to think about before you decide to teach in England:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>funding</span></li>
    <li><span>visas</span></li> 
    <li><span>travelling to the UK</span></li>
  </ul>
