   <h2>Advice for current trainees</h2>
        <p>If you are a current trainee teacher and have questions about your course, please contact your provider. This also applies if you are on an assessment only route.</p>
        <h2>Advice for applicants</h2>
        <p><strong>Q. Do I need to have school experience?</strong></p>
        <p>A. Getting some classroom experience can help you decide whether teaching is right for you. It is not an entry requirement for Initial Teacher Training.</p>
<p>You can search and sign up through our <a href="https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get school experience service<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new

<p><strong>Can I get school experience from September?</strong></p>
<p>Some schools are offering the opportunity for ITT candidates to undertake school experience both in school and virtually.</p>
<p>Candidates can search and sign up through our <a href="https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get school experience service<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new

        <p><strong>Q. Does the 40-day rule for making decisions about ITT applications still apply?</strong></p>
        <p>A. The 40-day rule for making decisions about ITT applications was reinstated on 1 June. This has now been reduced to 20 days.</p>
        <p><strong>Q. Do I have to have a face-to-face interview?</strong></p>
        <p>A. There is no requirement for a face-to-face interview. These can take place electronically, ideally by Skype or similar. Documentation such as degree and GCSE certificates may be scanned and sent electronically.</p>
        <p>Applicants should wait to be contacted by the providers for specific guidance.</p>
       <p><strong>Q. Are the planned Train To Teach events going ahead?</strong></p>
       <p>A. Autumn events have now been confirmed, please check the <a href="events">events page</a> for more information.</p>
       <p><strong> Q. What if I’m an overseas applicant?</strong></p>
        <p>A. Although global travel, including to the UK, is affected by coronavirus, we still encourage you to take the steps to becoming a teacher in England.</p> 
        <p>You should check your country’s advice as well as the UK's advice to keep up to date with travel restrictions and self-isolation requirements.
