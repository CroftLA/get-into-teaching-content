<h2>Wales, Scotland or Northern island</h2>

<p>If you live in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland you’ll need to contact your country’s student finance body. These finance bodies are:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><span>Student Finance Wales</span></li>
  <li><span>Student Awards Agency Scotland</span></li>
  <li><span>Student Finance NI</span></li>
  </ul>

<h2>EU students</h2>

<p>If you’re an EU national starting a teacher training course in the academic year 2020/21, you’ll be eligible for a bursary or scholarship, and a tuition fee loan. You need to have lived in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland for three years before the start of the course.</p>

<h2>Students from outside the EU</h2>

<p>Your tuition fees may be higher than fees for UK or EU/EEA students. Contact the university or training provider you want to train with to find out how much your fees will cost.</p>

<p>Get advice about training to be a teacher if you live outside the UK, EU/EAA by using Teacher Training Adviser Service.</p>

<p>There may be financial support available, but this will depend on your status as a home, EU/EEA or overseas student. Find out more from the UK Council for International Student Affairs.</p>
