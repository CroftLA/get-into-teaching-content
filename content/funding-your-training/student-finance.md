<p>If a bursary or scholarship is not available for your course, you can borrow money to help pay for your fees and living costs. You can apply for a tuition fee and/or a maintenance loan even if you already have a student loan.</p>

<h2> Apply for a tuition fee loan </h2>

<p>You can apply for a tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover the full cost of your course fees. This means you will not need to:</p>

<ul>

  <li><span>repay the loan until you’re working and earning money</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply for a maintenance loan</h2>

<p>You can apply for a maintenance loan of up to £11,672 to help with your living costs. You’ll repay the loan when you’re working and earning money.</p>
