  <p>They are only available in subjects where there is a shortage of teachers. You’ll need a first, 2:1, 2:2 degree or a PhD or Master's to be eligible.</p>

  <p>You could get a bursary of up to £26,000 or apply for a scholarship of up to £28,000.</p>

  <p>If a bursary or scholarship is not available for your course, you can borrow money to help pay for your fees and living costs. You can apply for a tuition fee and/or a maintenance loan even if you already have a student loan.</p>

  <p>You can apply for a tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover the full cost of your course fees and a maintenance loan of up to £11,672 to help with your living costs.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re a home student (living in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland), an EU student or a student from outside the EU, you may still be eligible for funding to train to teach.</p>

  <p>If you live in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland you’ll need to contact your country’s student finance body.</p>

  <p>If you’re an EU national starting a teacher training course in the academic year 2020/21, you could get a bursary or scholarship, and a tuition fee loan.</p>

  <p>If you live outside the UK or EU/EEA, you can get advice about training to be a teacher by using the Teacher Training Adviser Service.</p>
