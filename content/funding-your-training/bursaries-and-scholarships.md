<p>You may be able to get a bursary or scholarship. This is a tax-free amount of money to help you while you train. You don’t need to pay this back.</p>

<p>They are only available in subjects where there is a shortage of teachers. You’ll need a first, 2:1, 2:2 degree or a PhD or Master's to be eligible.</p>

<h2>Get a bursary</h2>

<p>You could get a bursary of up to £26,000. If the subject you want to teach is eligible for a bursary, you’ll get one when you start your course. You do not need to apply for a bursary.</p>

<h2>Apply for a scholarship</h2>

<p>You can apply for a scholarship of up to £28,000. You’d get this instead of a bursary. There’s a lot of competition for scholarships. Whether you get one will depend on the subject you want to teach and the grades you’ve got.</p>

<h2>Check which subjects have bursaries and scholarships</h2>

<p>If your subject is not listed, there is not a bursary or scholarship available. Primary teacher training bursaries are only available if you specialise in maths.</p>

<p>If you have an unrelated degree, but you studied the subject you want to teach at A level (or you have got professional experience in it) you could get a bursary for a subject knowledge enhancement course.</p>
