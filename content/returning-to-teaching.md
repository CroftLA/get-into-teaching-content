  <h2>Returning to teaching in England</h2>

  <p>Youâ€™ve decided you want to return to teaching.  You may have been inspired by homeschooling your own children during lockdown, or you simply want to pass on your experience, skills and knowledge gained in a different profession, onto pupils once you return to the classroom.</p>  

  <p>While you were away, the Department of Education has been working with schools to improve the life of a teacher by working with schools to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span>reduce workload</span></li>
    <li><span>improve behaviour</span></li>
    <li><span>introduce flexible working</span></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>For more detailed information read the <a href="https://beta-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/guidance#9" target="_blank">UK government guidance on returning to teaching in England</a>.</p>

  <p>If you're a returning maths, physics or modern languages teacher, we can offer you one-to-one support from a teacher training adviser.</p>

  <p>They can help you with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>finding teaching vacancies</span></li>
    <li><span>reviewing your knowledge</span></li>
    <li><span>writing your application</span></li>
    <li><span>preparing for interviews</span></li>
  </ul>
