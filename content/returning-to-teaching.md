  <p>You’re considering a return to teaching. You may have been inspired by home schooling children during lockdown, or you might want to pass on your professional skills and experience to the next generation.</p>
  <p>Whatever your reasons, you can get access to support and advice if you’re interested in coming back to teaching.</p>  

  <h2 id="how-were-improving-things-for-teachers">How we’re improving things for teachers</h2>
  
  <p>A lot has changed for teachers in England over the last few years. The Department for Education is working with schools to:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Reduce workload</span>
      <p>There has been a reduction between 2016 and 2019 in <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/838433/Teacher_workload_survey_2019_brief.pdf"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported working hours for teachers, middle leaders and senior leaders<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new

      <br/>
    </li>
    <li><span>Improve behaviour</span>
  <p>The Department for Education has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> invested £10m through Behaviour Hubs<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new
window)</span><i class="icon icon-external"></i></a> so that schools with exemplary behaviour can work closely with schools that want to improve behaviour.</p>
      <br/>
  </li>
    <li><span>Increase the offer of flexible working</span>
      <p>There are opportunities for teachers to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work flexibly<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(Link opens in new
