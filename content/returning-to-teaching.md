  <p>You’re considering a return to teaching. You may have been inspired by home schooling children during lockdown, or you might want to pass on your professional skills and experience to the next generation.</p>
  <p>Whatever your reasons, you can get access to support and advice if you’re interested in coming back to teaching.</p>  

  <h2 id="how-were-improving-things-for-teachers">How we’re improving things for teachers</h2>
  
  <p>A lot has changed for teachers in England over the last few years. The Department for Education is working with schools to:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Reduce workload</span>
      <p>Teachers, middle leaders and senior leaders reported working <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/838433/Teacher_workload_survey_2019_brief.pdf" target="_blank">5 hours less per week than they did in 2016</a>.</p>

    </li>
    <li><span>Improve behaviour</span>
  <p>The Department for Education has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs" target="_blank"> invested £10m through Behaviour Hubs</a> so that schools with exemplary behaviour can work closely with schools that want to improve behaviour.</p>
  </li>
