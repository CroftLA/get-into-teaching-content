<h3>Read Jill Mundy's experience of returning to teaching</h3>

<p>After 15 years away from teaching, Jill Mundy decided that it was time to revisit her first passion and re-enter the teaching profession.</p>

<p>“After almost a decade of teaching science, I Ieft the job in 2001 when my husband and I started a family. During my time out of the classroom, I did quite a lot of work for an exam board and lots of private tuition. This kept me occupied for many years. I did not think that it would be difficult to return to the classroom because of the demand for teachers, but in practice this proved quite a challenge.</p>

<p>I was from the age of chalk and paper and I had no recent school experience or experience using data to evaluate performance, nor did I have any referees still in the profession".</p>

<p>In 2016, I registered with the Department for Education’s (DfE) Return to Teaching Adviser service, which provided me with the necessary skills to return to teaching. My adviser from the service arranged for me to join a group at a local academy where I attended their in-house PGCE lectures.

<p>"The academy provided opportunities to observe lessons, and I was able to spend time in the behavioural inclusion unit. This is where I became interested in working outside mainstream education. Around this time, I registered with a supply agency and took a temporary post working with pupils with emotional and behavioural difficulties.</p>

<p>I continued to access professional development from DfE in behaviour management, and took a free teacher subject specialism training in maths, which was a unit from a master’s course. I also volunteered two days per week for two terms, working with pupils with similar special educational needs, which allowed me to gain further experience. I was given the opportunity to teach maths to year nine pupils and the school very kindly provided me with a reference in addition to the one from the supply agency.</p>

<p>My return to teaching adviser then arranged for me to attend Manchester Metropolitan University’s (MMU) teacher engagement programme. Here, I accessed further DfE funded training in computing in the classroom, job application writing, interview tips, and much more. I was fortunate enough to land a job before the course even finished – and I would have been unlikely to be successful were it not for the training I had received as a result of my contact with the Return to Teaching Adviser service.</p>

<p>MMU also worked to place other candidates in partner schools for work experience with the potential for a job offer.</p>

<p>Throughout the academic year, there was always Laura, my return to teaching adviser, at the end of the phone offering advice and support. Laura would review my applications and lesson plans and discuss interview feedback with me. It can be discouraging to attend interview after interview with what feels like no success - but Laura would always be positive and identify key learning points".</p>

<p>I’m now in my second year of teaching maths GCSE at an 11 to 16 alternative provision school and I am really enjoying it. I am very pleased to have been able to resume my career and very grateful to all concerned with the teacher training adviser service."</p>

<h3>Read Helen Watkins' top tips for returning to teaching</h3>

<p>After taking over a decade out to focus on her family, Helen Watkins decided she would like to return to teaching on a part-time basis. Here, she shares her top tips for getting through the job application process as a returning teacher:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Be prepared
<p>The interview process will likely include a number of different tasks so it is important to prepare as thoroughly as you can.</p>
<p>In one of my interviews, I was asked to prepare a 30 minute lesson on ‘An introduction to an A level topic’ for a year 10 class. I ensured I prepared for this scenario prior to the interview and ran my plan past my teacher training adviser, who offered advice on how to be as effective as possible.</p>
    <p>In addition to the lesson plan, it is important to be ready for any interview questions that you may face. There are a whole host of questions that the interview panel may ask, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe a good lesson and say why it is good</li>
      <li>What has been your worst lesson and why?</li>
      <li>How can you ensure that all pupils are challenged?</li>
      <li>How would you ensure good behaviour in a class?</li>
    </ul>
    
<p>The above are just a selection of the questions you may face in your interview, so it is important you are ready to discuss a wide range of topics.</p></li>


<li>Be resilient<p>Don’t necessarily expect to get the first job you apply for and don’t get disheartened if you're not successful. I didn’t get the first job I applied for when I decided to return to teaching. 
<p>The feedback I received from my interview panel was that my lesson was too ‘busy’. This feedback was invaluable and all part of the learning process. I addressed these concerns during my second job interview, and that time I was successful.</p></li>


<li>Try to get some relevant experience
<p>The four years I had as a science technician were invaluable to my learning and development. It helped to update my knowledge of the curriculum (especially the practicals!), got me back into a school environment and allowed me, at times, to lead demonstrations and assist in the planning and delivery of lessons.</p> <p>Refamiliarising yourself with the school environment by taking up a position such as this offers a great way of getting back into education, and will only enhance your application if you decide to take up teaching again.</p></li>

  <li>Show them who you really are!
<p>Preparation is clearly important when submitting an application or preparing for interview. However, it is important to also show your human side as the interview panel will be keen to see what characteristics you possess and how suited you are to teaching. I prepared for my interview, ensuring I allowed my personality to shine through, and was successful in my second interview.</p></li>

  <li>Get help from a professional adviser
<p>The support I’ve received from my teacher training adviser has been brilliant. The monthly updates have been very helpful as they have advised me of things I need to consider or actions I need to take. When a part time maternity cover job was advertised, my adviser checked my application forms and covering letter. When I got the interview, they happily checked over my lesson plan and resources prior to interview, which was fantastic. I am extremely relieved to discover that my adviser’s support will continue for the first two months of my new post.</p></li>
