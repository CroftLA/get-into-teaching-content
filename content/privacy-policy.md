   <h3>Why our use of your personal data is lawful</h3>

   <p>In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation. You have requested to receive this service and therefore, together with this privacy notice (about the use of your personal data), you have agreed to your data being used to deliver the service. However, the condition that we are relying on (once you have agreed to receiving the service) is that under Article 6 (1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) DfE is processing your personal data in the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.</p>

   <h3>Who we will make your personal data available to</h3>

   <p>We share your information with trusted partners working to deliver the service under a legal contract on our behalf in order for us to continue to provide you with relevant information about a career in teaching and teacher training or 'the service'. These partners are required to strictly comply with our privacy policies that prohibit them using your personal data for any other purpose.</p>

   <p>We share certain personal data with UCAS Teacher Training, who manage the application system for teacher training. Sharing personal information with UCAS Teacher Training enables us to identify those who have applied for teacher training, and remove the names of these applicants from our communication list. </p>

   <p>We also share data to track your application in order to determine the effectiveness of our service, monitor overall levels of teacher training applicants and improve it for you and future applicants.</p>

   <p>If you are using the Get School Experience service, we will share some of your personal data to the staff who manage school experience at the school where you've requested school experience. This allows them to process your application and get back to you about your school experience.</p>

   <h3>How long we will keep your personal data</h3>

   <p>Your personal data, supplied for the purposes of this service, will be stored in our customer relationship management system for 5 years. We will delete this information if you request us to do so.</p>

   <h3>Your data protection rights</h3>

   <p>You have the right:</p>

   <ul>
        <li><span>to ask us for access to information about you that we hold</span></li>
        <li><span>to have your personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete</span></li>
        <li><span>to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing</span></li>
        <li><span>to restrict our processing of your personal data (i.e. permitting its storage but no further processing)</span></li>
        <li><span>to object to direct marketing (including profiling) and processing for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.</span></li>
    </ul>
